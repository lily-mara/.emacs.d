My Emacs Configuration
===

This is a fairly customized emacs install designed to emulate Vim. I was
a heavy Vim user before I was coerced to the dark side. This repo seeks to
allow as seamless a transition as possible from Vim to emacs.

Install

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/natemara/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d
$ cd ~/.emacs.d
$ python boostrap.py
$ emacs -nw
$ emacs
```
